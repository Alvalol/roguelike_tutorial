At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1). Come and check this out!

I'll be diverging a bit from the main Python tutorial by implementing Esper's entity component system. I'll be also using libtcod-cffi for it's new console class, and numpy arrays for the game map.
